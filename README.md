Hello! This is an old version of [Cursor](https://cursor.so/) based off of the [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) text editing component. If you're looking to build your own code editor from the ground-up, this may serve as a useful guide üôÇ Cursor is now based on a fork of VSCodium.

cd cursor
npm i
```

Then, download some non-versioned dependencies (ripgrep binaries and language server js):

```

Finally, to run the client:

```
npm start
```
